AutoSuggest 2.0 uses multiple sources of suggestions, such as TM, termbase, machine translation and concordance search. It also supports fuzzy matches and synonyms, so you can find the best option for your context.
- **Quality Assurance Checker**: This is a feature that helps you ensure the quality and consistency of your translations. Quality Assurance Checker can detect and flag potential errors such as spelling, grammar, punctuation, terminology, numbers, tags and formatting. You can customize the quality settings according to your preferences and project requirements.
- **Project Management**: This is a feature that allows you to create, manage and share translation projects with ease. Project Management lets you define project settings such as languages, file types, TM, termbase and quality checks.
